        <h2>Common Problems in Research (CPR)</h2>
            <p>
            In our research, encountering problems is not just inevitable but also essential for the learning process. These challenges play a crucial role in advancing our understanding and skills. For our students, these problems serve as valuable learning opportunities, allowing them to practice and develop strategies to overcome common obstacles they may face in their research careers.
            </p>
            <p>
            By systematically breaking these problems down into their simplest components, we create an environment where students can tackle each issue in a structured and manageable way. This methodical approach helps students build a strong foundation, enabling them to approach complex problems with confidence and clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
            Moreover, by working through these problems, students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are directly applicable to their research. They learn to identify potential pitfalls early on and devise strategies to address them effectively. This not only enhances their research capabilities but also prepares them for the unpredictable nature of scientific inquiry, where new challenges often arise.
            </p>
            <p>
            Ultimately, this process fosters resilience and adaptability, qualities that are essential for success in any research endeavor. By turning problems into learning opportunities, we empower our students to become more proficient researchers, capable of navigating the complexities of their fields with confidence and skill.
